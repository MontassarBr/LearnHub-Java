Got it 👍 Since your project is **LearnHub (Java Swing + MySQL)**, I’ll draft a professional **README.md** that looks great on GitHub and includes placeholders for 7 screenshots.

You’ll only need to replace the `![Screenshot X](path/to/screenshot.png)` with the correct relative paths (e.g., `screenshots/login.png`) once you upload your images to your repo.

Here’s the `README.md` 👇

👉 Do you want me to also **generate a `screenshots/` folder structure and sample placeholder images** (so your repo looks professional before adding real screenshots), or do you already have real screenshots ready?
